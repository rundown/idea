A small and light MVC framework for "PHP" development 


Idea was born as an idea for quick MVC development for small PHP application/sites.
This is by no means a full fledged framework, but only provides implementation of an MVC.
To use a huge framework would have taken time, so this is a lightweight one. Feel free to use.
